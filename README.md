The goal is simple.

There are two fragments: MainFragment and DetailFragment.

For both fragments there should be a navigation drawer which should appear behind the status bar.
Both fragments should have a toolbar. For the DetailFragment the toolbar should be transparent and an image should be behind the toolbar up to the statusbar.
